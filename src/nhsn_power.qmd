# Introduction  

Using the National Healthcare and Safety Network public use data, we perform some power calculations for a hypothetical vaccine trial in the 2023-2024 season. 

# Inclusion criteria

The total dataset includes ~15,000 nursing homes. We limit the data to those homes with complete data from 2023-2025, and homes where the mean weekly vaccination rate is >=20%, and the average weekly census is >= 50.
